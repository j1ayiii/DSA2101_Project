## Project Question: Who is the main contributor of deforestation over time, and why?

### Introduction 
The deforestation data set provides vital information about deforestation trends around the world, as well as a data set specifically about Brazil. This data is from [*Our World in
Data*](https://ourworldindata.org/forests-and-deforestation), comprising of 5 CSV files. Breaking down these CSV files:

1.  `forest.csv` shows the change in forest area every 5 years.
2.  `forest_area.csv` shows the change in forest area as a percentage of
    the global forest area.
3.  `brazil_loss.csv` shows the loss of Brazil's forests due to various
    reasons such as pasture and commercial use.
4.  `soybean_use.csv` shows the use and production of soybeans by
    country and year (annually).
5.  `vegetable_oil.csv` shows the trend of vegetable oil production by
    year and country.

In our project, we are using 4 data sets mentioned above, namely `forest.csv`, `brazil_loss.csv`, `soybean_use.csv` and `vegetable_oil.csv`.

### Project Aim
Our group aims to identify the country with the most extensive forest destruction and the highest deforestation rates across the years. Additionally, we intend to discover the underlying causes behind the high deforestation rates in that country.
